## My great books project

I've always been a serious reader, widely ranging across fiction, history and technical topics.  When I turned 50 and starting to feel like my days were numbered, I decided to add some discipline to the approach to make sure I read the best books.  

I compiled a list from various sources of best books, including Man Booker, Pulitzer, etc prize winners.  I added various lists from New York Times, including their annual 10 best list.  I also added from serveral 100 best of all time lists.  

There is an excel spreadsheet in the repository which I periodically update with new winners and announcements along with my reading progress.  To access the repository, click on the link to the left.
